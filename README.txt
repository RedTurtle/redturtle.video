Introduction
============

A simple video support for Plone, mainly based on `collective.flowplayer`__.

__ http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.flowplayer

Features
========

This add to your Plone portal two new types:

* *Video file* for providing a video content directly from a video file compatible with flowplayer
  formats. In the video view you can copy/paste the video embedding code, for seeing this video in other
  sites.
* *Video link* for a remote video resource

Also you can insert the *year* of the video and the *duration*.

A "Look" section will also give you fields for:

* add an optional image field, for the video screenshot/splashscreen data
* video display size

Internal video
--------------

Add to your site a new "Video file", then provide a video format compatible with `Flowplayer`__.
When you save it RedTurtle Video try to take from the video source some metadata like the *duration*
and video size (width and height). Later you can modify those values manually.

If you provided also the image field, this can be used (optionally) as video starting splash image.
All other amazing features came directly from the power of ``collective.flowplayer``.

Remote video
------------

Always wrapping ``collective.flowplayer`` features, you can provide a special kind of link that point to
a compatible format resource. Again you can play with all additional fields, adjusting video size and
metadata.

The link can be to a remote site that host ``flv`` of other compatible types, or a link to an "Video file"
in the same Plone site.

Remote video providers
----------------------

One of the most interesting feature is the support to *URL to 3rd party remote video services* like:

* YouTube (http://www.youtube.com/) - using `collective.rtvideo.youtube`__
* Vimeo (http://vimeo.com/) - still internal feature
* Metacafe (http://www.metacafe.com/) - still internal feature

Enhancing this list with additional providers is quite simple (see the `documentation`__ given with the product).
You are welcome to contribute and release other ``collective.rtvideo.yourpreferredremoteservice`` add-on!

Portlet
-------

Also this will give you a new "*Video gallery*" portlet, similar to the ones you'll get with
``collective.flowplayer`` ("Video player").

This portlet will show links to a configurable set of videos, displaying in the portlet the splash image.

You can still use basic "Video player" portlet given by ``collective.flowplayer``.

Default size
------------

Default video size (that you can change from the "Look" fieldset) is 400x300. You can change this default
going to ZMI, in ``portal_properties`` and change values in ``redturtle_video_properties``.

Requirements
============

Tested on Plone 3.3, 4.0 and 4.1

Installation
============

Using buildout::

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        redturtle.video

To add also additional video providers support::

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        redturtle.video
        collective.rtvideo.youtube
        ...
        mycompany.myservice

Plone 3.2 or lower users: don't forget ``zcml`` section.

Support
=======

If you find bugs or have a good suggestion, open a ticket at
http://plone.org/products/redturtle.video/issues/

TODO
====

* video transcript field: can be useful?
* move away, to other packages named ``collective.rtvideo.xxx``, all video adapters left.
  It's silly to release a new ``redturtle.video`` version if something change on one of the remote services.

Other products
==============

Before choosing this product think about what you want to get from "Plone and Video".
We strongly suggest you to use ``redturtle.video`` only when:

* The simple use of ``collective.flowplayer`` if not enough (you don't like to upload a "File" that magically
  became a Video? You need remote video support? You need a real new plone content type to make Collections?)
* The use of `Plumi`__ suite is "too much" (you don't need a full video site, just a simple video support inside
  you CMS)
* You need to have Video as real CMS contents, not only use them embedded in document text (a task that you can
  reach easily using `collective.embedly`__)

You can also be interested looking at the `Plone Video Suite`__ discussions.
